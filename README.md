Assume Null Hypothesis as Ho: Independence of categorical variables
(customer order forms defective % does not varies by centre)
Thus, Alternative hypothesis as Ha Dependence of categorical variables

i.e. Independence of categorical variables Thus, customer order forms
defective % does not varies by centre.
